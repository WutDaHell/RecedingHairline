Oh hey,  my name is Stephanie
I work at Best Buy as a supervisor and used to be an assistant supervisor in a Domino's pizzeria
I'm 18 years old and I've been in the workforce for a decade
Sometimes, you regret your choices, because you thought that it was the best decision when it wasn't
I regret some things I've done in the past, because it involved a certain person in my life who was very remarkable
But, that doesn't mean you need to give up in life for a minor mishap
Be resistant and overcome the obstacles of life
For it shall give some meaning in your life
